/* IE 7 & 8 Reset --------------------------- */
// This file will handle MSIE browsers versions 7 and 8 as one entity.
// Body class .ie7_8 {} is the target.
// The primary consideration is that we will do away with liquid layout, which
// will alleviate the majority of styling issues.
// The expectation here is user is on a 1024 screen as most analytics have shown
// that is the strongest correlation between resolution and older versions of IE
// Rules rescinded: pixel sizing and !important declaration are allowable.
